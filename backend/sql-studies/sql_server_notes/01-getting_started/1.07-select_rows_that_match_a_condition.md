Generally, the syntax is:

```sql
SELECT <column names>
FROM <table name>
WHERE <condition>
```

For example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, Age
FROM Users
WHERE LastName = 'Smith'
```
Conditions can be complex:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, Age
FROM Users
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' AND (City = 'New York' OR City = 'Los Angeles')
```
