Comments are preceded by -- and are ignored until a new line is encountered:
```sql
-- This is a comment
SELECT *
FROM MyTable -- This is another comment
WHERE Id = 1;
```
Slash star comments begin with /* and end with */. All text between those delimiters is considered as a comment
block.

<br>
<hr>

```sql
/* This is
a multi-line
comment block. */
SELECT Id = 1, [Message] = 'First row'
UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 'Second row'
/* This is a one liner */
SELECT 'More';
```
Slash star comments have the advantage of keeping the comment usable if the SQL Statement loses new line
characters. This can happen when SQL is captured during troubleshooting
