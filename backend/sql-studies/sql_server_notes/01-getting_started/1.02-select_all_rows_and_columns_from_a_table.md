Using the asterisk operator * serves as a shortcut for selecting all the columns in the table. All rows will also be selected because this SELECT statement does not have a WHERE clause, to specify any filtering criteria.

This would also work the same way if you added an alias to the table, for instance e in this case:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees AS e
```

- Or if you wanted to select all from a specific table you can use the alias + " .* ":

```sql
SELECT e.*, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees AS e
 INNER JOIN Department AS d
 ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
```

Database objects may also be accesed using fully qualified names:
```sql
SELECT * FROM [server_name].[database_name].[schema_name].[table_name]
```

- This is not necessarily recommended, as changing the server and/or database names would cause the queries
using fully-qualified names to no longer execute due to invalid object names.

> Warning: Using SELECT * in production code or stored procedures can lead to problems later on (as new columns are added to the table, or if columns are rearranged in the table), especially if your code makes simple assumptions about the order of columns, or number of columns returned. So it's safer to always explicitly specify column names in SELECT statements for production code.
