A simple form of updating is incrementing all the values in a given field of the table. In order to do so, we need to define the field and the increment value

- The following is an example that increments the Score field by 1 (in all rows):

```sql
UPDATE Scores
SET score = score + 1 
```

This can be dangerous since you can corrupt your data if you accidentally make an UPDATE for a specific Row with
an UPDATE for All rows in the table.
